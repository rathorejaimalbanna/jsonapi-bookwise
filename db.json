      "publishedDate": "2016",
      "description": "To build high-quality software, you need to write testable code. That's harder than it seems: it requires insights drawn from arenas ranging from software craftsmanship to unit testing, refactoring to test-driven development. Most programming books either discuss testing only briefly, or drill down on just one or two techniques, with little guidance on how to systematically verify code. Most testing books, on the other hand, focus on a specific testing process, without showing how to write software that can be easily and systematically tested. In Developer Testing, leading software engineering consultant Alexander Tarnowski strikes an optimal balance, integrating insights from multiple disciplines to help frustrated practitioners get better results. Drawing on his extensive experience as a mentor and trainer, he offers insights that help you accelerate through the typical software assurance learning curve, so you can progress far more rapidly. Tarnowski organizes his insights into \"chunks\" to help you quickly absorb key concepts, and focuses on technology-agnostic approaches you can keep using with any new language, platform, or toolset. The first guide to cover testing mindset, techniques, and applications from the developer's perspective, Developer Testing will help developers get what they really want: better code. -- Provided by publisher.",

      "publishedDate": "2021-01-12",
      "description": "Jeff Lawson, developer turned CEO of Twilio (one of Bloomberg Businessweek's Top 50 Companies to Watch in 2021), creates a new playbook for unleashing the full potential of software developers in any organization, showing how to help management utilize this coveted and valuable workforce to enable growth, solve a wide range of business problems, and drive digital transformation. From banking and retail to insurance and finance, every industry is turning digital, and every company needs the best software to win the hearts and minds of customers. The landscape has shifted from the classic build vs. buy question, to one of build vs. die. Companies have to get this right to survive. But how do they make this transition? Software developers are sought after, highly paid, and desperately needed to compete in the modern, digital economy. Yet most companies treat them like digital factory workers without really understanding how to unleash their full potential. Lawson argues that developers are the creative workforce who can solve major business problems and create hit products for customers—not just grind through rote tasks. From Google and Amazon, to one-person online software companies—companies that bring software developers in as partners are winning. Lawson shows how leaders who build industry changing software products consistently do three things well. First, they understand why software developers matter more than ever. Second, they understand developers and know how to motivate them. And third, they invest in their developers' success. As a software developer and public company CEO, Lawson uses his unique position to bridge the language and tools executives use with the unique culture of high performing, creative software developers. Ask Your Developer is a toolkit to help business leaders, product managers, technical leaders, software developers, and executives achieve their common goal—building great digital products and experiences. How to compete in the digital economy? In short: Ask Your Developer.",

      "description": "“A must read for all developers that want to begin serious Android development.” —Justin Anderson, Freelance Android Developer “From start to finish, this book contains a variety of great tips and insight into the most important attributes of Android design. This book will definitely be required reading for any of our future Android engineers.” —Cameron Banga, Cofounder, 9magnets, LLC There’s a downside to Android’s amazing openness and versatility: it’s easy for developers to write code that’s inefficient, unreliable, insecure, or hard to maintain. In Android Development Patterns , enterprise Android developer Phil Dutson helps you leverage Android 5.0+’s amazing power without falling victim to those pitfalls. Dutson presents today’s most comprehensive set of patterns and procedures for building optimized, robust apps with Android 5.0+. First, Dutson guides you through establishing a highly efficient development environment and workflow, and testing your app to ensure that your code works just as you expect. Then, he walks through the modern best practices for structuring apps, using widgets and components, and working with views. You learn how to build apps that are easy to manage and update, deliver accurate and up-to-date information without wasting precious battery power, and take advantage of new hardware, such as Android Wear and Android TV. Dutson concludes by presenting powerful strategies for optimizing your apps and packaging them for distribution. Coverage includes Using testing to build more trustworthy, dependable, maintainable apps Understanding subtle but critical differences between Android and traditional Java programming Building consistent, modern user interfaces with views and layouts Leveraging the proven MVC pattern to cleanly organize logic Creating rich visual experiences with 3D graphics, animation, and media Simplifying capture and use of location data with the new Locations API Integrating optional hardware, such as Bluetooth, NFC, or USB Building better apps with Google Play Services Creating Android Wear notifications and apps Tuning and improving apps with Google Analytics Designing Android TV apps for the “ten foot view” informit.com/aw https://github.com/dutsonpa/adp-files",

      "description": "\"Two thumbs up\" —Gregory V. Wilson, Dr. Dobbs Journal (October 2004) No one can disparage the ability to write good code. At its highest levels, it is an art. But no one can confuse writing good code with developing good software. The difference—in terms of challenges, skills, and compensation—is immense. Coder to Developer helps you excel at the many non-coding tasks entailed, from start to finish, in just about any successful development project. What's more, it equips you with the mindset and self-assurance required to pull it all together, so that you see every piece of your work as part of a coherent process. Inside, you'll find plenty of technical guidance on such topics as: Choosing and using a source code control system Code generation tools--when and why Preventing bugs with unit testing Tracking, fixing, and learning from bugs Application activity logging Streamlining and systematizing the build process Traditional installations and alternative approaches To pull all of this together, the author has provided the source code for Download Tracker, a tool for organizing your collection of downloaded code, that's used for examples throughout this book. The code is provided in various states of completion, reflecting every stage of development, so that you can dig deep into the actual process of building software. But you'll also develop \"softer\" skills, in areas such as team management, open source collaboration, user and developer documentation, and intellectual property protection. If you want to become someone who can deliver not just good code but also a good product, this book is the place to start. If you must build successful software projects, it's essential reading.",

      "description": "A visual and accessible guide to JavaScript and jQuery in a built-to-last hardcover edition In JavaScript & jQuery renowned author Jon Duckett discards the traditional programming book template and approaches writing code in a more relevant, less intimidating way. Full-color and packed with instructional graphics and photos, his books have gained a loyal following by illustrating programming in a way both instructive for newcomers and invaluable for seasoned coders. By discussing JavaScript and jQuery in a single text, Duckett ensures you will quickly be writing your own working scripts. Yet the book doesn't assume you have experience in either JavaScript or jQuery. By making use of popular jQuery plugins, Duckett illustrates techniques that would require pages upon pages of detailed explanation if you were being taught to create the plugins yourself. This durable and attractive hardcover edition is a book you will have open on your desk as a reference for years to come. A timeless and lasting version of a classic \"Duckett\" book in a hardbound, dust-jacketed edition Completely accessible to those who feel intimidated by the subject matter and relevant to all front-end designers and developers who need to understand JavaScript Discusses applying responsive design techniques, leveraging APIs to save you time and work in coding, and identifying when to use CSS transforms over pure JavaScript Beautiful 4-color illustrations and examples make this a terrific academic resource for those of all experience levels JavaScript & jQuery clearly explains the jargon of programming, addressing the vocabulary without making it a prerequisite for readers. Duckett speaks directly to readers, making this an invaluable resource. This book is also available as a set, Web Design with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery Set 978119038634 along with HTML and CSS Design and Build Websites 9781118871645.",

      "publishedDate": "2018-12-04",
      "description": "Completely revised and updated, this best-selling introduction to programming in JavaScript focuses on writing real applications. JavaScript lies at the heart of almost every modern web application, from social apps like Twitter to browser-based game frameworks like Phaser and Babylon. Though simple for beginners to pick up and play with, JavaScript is a flexible, complex language that you can use to build full-scale applications. This much anticipated and thoroughly revised third edition of Eloquent JavaScript dives deep into the JavaScript language to show you how to write beautiful, effective code. It has been updated to reflect the current state of Java¬Script and web browsers and includes brand-new material on features like class notation, arrow functions, iterators, async functions, template strings, and block scope. A host of new exercises have also been added to test your skills and keep you on track. As with previous editions, Haverbeke continues to teach through extensive examples and immerses you in code from the start, while exercises and full-chapter projects give you hands-on experience with writing your own programs. You start by learning the basic structure of the JavaScript language as well as control structures, functions, and data structures to help you write basic programs. Then you'll learn about error handling and bug fixing, modularity, and asynchronous programming before moving on to web browsers and how JavaScript is used to program them. As you build projects such as an artificial life simulation, a simple programming language, and a paint program, you'll learn how to: - Understand the essential elements of programming, including syntax, control, and data - Organize and clarify your code with object-oriented and functional programming techniques - Script the browser and make basic web applications - Use the DOM effectively to interact with browsers - Harness Node.js to build servers and utilities Isn't it time you became fluent in the language of the Web? * All source code is available online in an inter¬active sandbox, where you can edit the code, run it, and see its output instantly.",

If you are new to JavaScript, it will teach you the language. If you are already a JavaScript programmer, Part I will sharpen your skills and deepen your understanding of the language. Part II explains the scripting environment provided by web browsers, with a focus on DOM scripting with unobtrusive JavaScript. The broad and deep coverage of client-side JavaScript is illustrated with many sophisticated examples that demonstrate how to: Generate a table of contents for an HTML document Display DHTML animations Automate form validation Draw dynamic pie charts Make HTML elements draggable Define keyboard shortcuts for web applications Create Ajax-enabled tool tips Use XPath and XSLT on XML documents loaded with Ajax And much more Part III is a complete reference for core JavaScript. It documents every class, object, constructor, method, function, property, and constant defined by JavaScript 1.5 and ECMAScript Version 3. Part IV is a reference for client-side JavaScript, covering legacy web browser APIs, the standard Level 2 DOM API, and emerging standards such as the XMLHttpRequest object and the canvas tag. More than 300,000 JavaScript programmers around the world have madethis their indispensable reference book for building JavaScript applications. \"A must-have reference for expert JavaScript programmers...well-organized and detailed.\" -- Brendan Eich, creator of JavaScript",

      "description": "A New York Times bestseller and Oprah Book Club 2.0 selection, the epic, unforgettable story of a man determined to protect the woman he loves from the town desperate to destroy her. This beautiful and devastating debut heralds the arrival of a major new voice in fiction. Ephram Jennings has never forgotten the beautiful girl with the long braids running through the piney woods of Liberty, their small East Texas town. Young Ruby Bell, “the kind of pretty it hurt to look at,” has suffered beyond imagining, so as soon as she can, she flees suffocating Liberty for the bright pull of 1950s New York. Ruby quickly winds her way into the ripe center of the city—the darkened piano bars and hidden alleyways of the Village—all the while hoping for a glimpse of the red hair and green eyes of her mother. When a telegram from her cousin forces her to return home, thirty-year-old Ruby finds herself reliving the devastating violence of her girlhood. With the terrifying realization that she might not be strong enough to fight her way back out again, Ruby struggles to survive her memories of the town’s dark past. Meanwhile, Ephram must choose between loyalty to the sister who raised him and the chance for a life with the woman he has loved since he was a boy. Full of life, exquisitely written, and suffused with the pastoral beauty of the rural South, Ruby is a transcendent novel of passion and courage. This wondrous page-turner rushes through the red dust and gossip of Main Street, to the pit fire where men swill bootleg outside Bloom’s Juke, to Celia Jennings’s kitchen, where a cake is being made, yolk by yolk, that Ephram will use to try to begin again with Ruby. Utterly transfixing, with unforgettable characters, riveting suspense, and breathtaking, luminous prose, Ruby offers an unflinching portrait of man’s dark acts and the promise of the redemptive power of love. Ruby was a finalist for the PEN America Robert Bingham Debut Novel Award, a Barnes & Noble Discover Great New Writers selection, and an Indie Next Pick.",

While other books focus on Ruby's trendier features, The Book of Ruby reveals the secret inner workings of one of the world's most popular programming languages, teaching you to write clear, maintainable code. You'll start with the basics—types, data structures, and control flows—and progress to advanced features like blocks, mixins, metaclasses, and beyond. Rather than bog you down with a lot of theory, The Book of Ruby takes a hands-on approach and focuses on making you productive from day one. As you follow along, you’ll learn to: –Leverage Ruby's succinct and flexible syntax to maximize your productivity –Balance Ruby's functional, imperative, and object-oriented features –Write self-modifying programs using dynamic programming techniques –Create new fibers and threads to manage independent processes concurrently –Catch and recover from execution errors with robust exception handling –Develop powerful web applications with the Ruby on Rails framework Each chapter includes a \"Digging Deeper\" section that shows you how Ruby works under the hood, so you'll never be caught off guard by its deceptively simple scoping, multithreading features, or precedence rules. Whether you're new to programming or just new Ruby, The Book of Ruby is your guide to rapid, real-world software development with this unique and elegant language.",

      "description": "It’s easy to write correct Ruby code, but to gain the fluency needed to write great Ruby code, you must go beyond syntax and absorb the “Ruby way” of thinking and problem solving. In Eloquent Ruby, Russ Olsen helps you write Ruby like true Rubyists do–so you can leverage its immense, surprising power. Olsen draws on years of experience internalizing the Ruby culture and teaching Ruby to other programmers. He guides you to the “Ah Ha!” moments when it suddenly becomes clear why Ruby works the way it does, and how you can take advantage of this language’s elegance and expressiveness. Eloquent Ruby starts small, answering tactical questions focused on a single statement, method, test, or bug. You’ll learn how to write code that actually looks like Ruby (not Java or C#); why Ruby has so many control structures; how to use strings, expressions, and symbols; and what dynamic typing is really good for. Next, the book addresses bigger questions related to building methods and classes. You’ll discover why Ruby classes contain so many tiny methods, when to use operator overloading, and when to avoid it. Olsen explains how to write Ruby code that writes its own code–and why you’ll want to. He concludes with powerful project-level features and techniques ranging from gems to Domain Specific Languages. A part of the renowned Addison-Wesley Professional Ruby Series, Eloquent Ruby will help you “put on your Ruby-colored glasses” and get results that make you a true believer.",

      "description": "There is no shortage of programming languages and frameworks out there. But in the midst of all this, Ruby on Rails stands out. Despite losing out on the top spot to other contenders, Ruby on Rails has earned for itself a position of repute and a robust user base. Ever since its debut in 2004, Ruby on Rails has rapidly become one of the most impactful and popular tools for building dynamic web applications. Rails owes much of its success to its compact design and the usage of the underlying Ruby language. It effectively creates a domain-specific language for writing web applications. As a result, many common web programming tasks—such as generating HTML, making data models, and routing URLs—are easier with Rails. Although its outstanding capabilities have made Ruby on Rails one of the world’s most popular web development frameworks, some might still find it challenging to learn and use. Mastering Ruby on Rails: A Beginner’s Guide could be just the right solution for that. Whatever your previous web development experience is, Mastering Ruby on Rails can guide you to true Rails proficiency. It will help you to: Install and set up your Rails development environment Go beyond generated code to build Rails applications from scratch Effectively use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern Master the Ruby programming skills all Rails developers need Define high-quality site layouts and data models Add social features and navigate Asynchronous Javascript and XML (Ajax) Mastering Ruby on Rails will walk you through Rails' inner workings and equip you to tackle complicated projects with solutions that are well-tested, adaptive, and easy to maintain. This book starts by explaining critical points behind object-oriented programming and builds toward creating a full Rails application within a few chapters. By the end of this book, besides in-depth knowledge of Rails, you will also have a basic understanding of many supporting technologies such as SQL, web frameworks, and Integrated Development Environment (IDE). You will be able to quickly grasp the Rails methodology by focusing on the development from the point of view of the beginner-level developer. Additionally, you will be provided with a reliable roadmap for migrating your applications, skill set, and development procedures to the newer, more flexible programming platform that Rails offers. Moreover, learning Rails development independently will let you use all the qualities like creativeness, critical thinking, and project management. Mastering Ruby on Rails serves as a complete guide to exploring Ruby on Rails, expanding your set of skills and experience that will only benefit you throughout your professional life.

RoR has grown year over year in notoriety and popularity among developers because its ease of use and speed for which a Web developer can build and maintain Web sites and applications. One of its key principles is using less code for application development by avoiding redundancy and following Rails conventions, encouraging increased performance, but with less development time. Ruby on Rails Bible takes all that is key to this framework and programming language and details it in one concise guide for all user levels. Coverage includes an introduction and summary of the Ruby programming language, followed by complete in-depth coverage of the Ruby on Rails framework. In addition to chapters detailing all of the features of Rails, a separate section of the book will provide a walkthrough of the development of a complete Rails web application utilizing much of what is taught earlier in the book. Current hot development trends including Agile development, Web Services, Web 2.0, and Ajax will be covered from the Rails perspective too.",

      "description": "Nikola Tesla was a major contributor to the electrical revolution that transformed daily life at the turn of the twentieth century. His inventions, patents, and theoretical work formed the basis of modern AC electricity, and contributed to the development of radio and television. Like his competitor Thomas Edison, Tesla was one of America's first celebrity scientists, enjoying the company of New York high society and dazzling the likes of Mark Twain with his electrical demonstrations. An astute self-promoter and gifted showman, he cultivated a public image of the eccentric genius. Even at the end of his life when he was living in poverty, Tesla still attracted reporters to his annual birthday interview, regaling them with claims that he had invented a particle-beam weapon capable of bringing down enemy aircraft. Plenty of biographies glamorize Tesla and his eccentricities, but until now none has carefully examined what, how, and why he invented. In this groundbreaking book, W. Bernard Carlson demystifies the legendary inventor, placing him within the cultural and technological context of his time, and focusing on his inventions themselves as well as the creation and maintenance of his celebrity. Drawing on original documents from Tesla's private and public life, Carlson shows how he was an \"idealist\" inventor who sought the perfect experimental realization of a great idea or principle, and who skillfully sold his inventions to the public through mythmaking and illusion. This major biography sheds new light on Tesla's visionary approach to invention and the business strategies behind his most important technological breakthroughs.",

      "description": "*A Wall Street Journal Business Bestseller* 'A deeply reported and business-savvy chronicle of Tesla's wild ride' --Walter Isaacson 'A masterclass in narrative journalism' --Bradley Hope 'Exemplary' --The Times 'An exceptional work' --Washington Post Inside the outrageous, come-from-behind story of Elon Musk and Tesla's bid to build the world's greatest car and the race to drive the future. Elon Musk is among the most controversial titans of Silicon Valley. To some he's a genius and a visionary and to others he's a mercurial huckster. Billions of dollars have been gained and lost on his tweets and his personal exploits are the stuff of tabloids. But for all his outrageous talk of mind-uploading and space travel, his most audacious vision is the one closest to the ground: the electric car. When Tesla was founded in the 2000s, electric cars were novelties, trotted out and thrown on the scrap heap by carmakers for more than a century. But where most onlookers saw only failure, a small band of Silicon Valley engineers and entrepreneurs saw potential and they pitted themselves against the biggest, fiercest business rivals in the world, setting out to make a car that was quicker, sexier, smoother, cleaner than the competition. Tesla would undergo a truly hellish fifteen years, beset by rivals, pressured by investors, hobbled by whistleblowers, buoyed by its loyal supporters. Musk himself would often prove Tesla's worst enemy--his antics repeatedly taking the company he had funded himself to the brink of collapse. Was he an underdog, an antihero, a conman, or some combination of the three? Wall Street Journal tech and auto reporter Tim Higgins had a front-row seat for the drama: the pileups, wrestling for control, meltdowns, and the unlikeliest outcome of all, success. A story of power, recklessness, struggle, and triumph, Power Play is an exhilarating look at how a team of eccentrics and innovators beat the odds... and changed the future.",

It is often said that with its business model and its special strategic moves, Tesla confuses competitors, utilities and marketing agencies. Therefore, this assignment will focus on the analysis of the key aspects of Tesla’s business model in order to find out why it is considered to be different. Moreover, the objective of this assessment is to find out, whether this strategy is useful, or if it should be changed. The market definition and analysis of the first assignment is hereby the basis for this evaluation of Tesla Motor’s current marketing strategy. Therefore, the focus will be again on the company’s domestic market: the United States of America. Furthermore, only Tesla’s automotive products will be taken into consideration – its recently launched home battery will not be object of this work.",

Any city at any distance whatsoever from the enemy can be destroyed by him and no power on Earth can stop him from doing so.” —Nikola Tesla, circa 1925 Drawing on forty years of research and a treasure trove of new information, Tesla: Wizard at War provides a comprehensive view of Tesla’s discoveries, which continue to influence today’s military technology and diplomatic strategies. One of the world’s leading Tesla experts, Marc J. Seifer offers new insight into the brilliant scientist’s particle beam weapon (aka the “Death Ray”) and explores his military negotiations with pivotal historical figures—including his links to Joseph Stalin, Vannevar Bush, General Andrew McNaughton, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. From Tesla’s role in the origins of Star Wars technology and his dynamic theory of gravity, to the real purpose behind the iconic tower at Wardenclyffe, this is an eye-opening account of Tesla’s projects, passions, and ambitions—and an illuminating, important study of one of history’s most intriguing figures.",

There was a time when major English writers – P. G. Wodehouse, Arthur Conan Doyle, Alec Waugh – took time off to write about cricket, whereas the cricket book market today is dominated by ghosted autobiographies and statistical compendiums. The Picador Book of Cricket celebrates the best writing on the game and includes many pieces that have been out of print, or difficult to get hold of, for years. Including Neville Cardus, C. L. R. James, John Arlott, V. S. Naipaul, and C. B. Fry, this anthology is a must for any cricket follower or anyone interested in sports writing elevated to high art.",

This book contains an impressive array of Gulu’s articles on a wide range of sports with an emphasis on cricket which is so close to Gulu’s heart. There are numerous articles on the India Premier League in this collection stretching back to its origins and the reader can judge for himself how perceptive Gulu has been on this vexing issue. On this we share common ground and many of our dire predictions on what we both consider a cancer in the game have proved uncannily correct. Besides controversies, there is much to celebrate as well in this anthology and I wish both the book and its author all the best while looking forward to another such collection 20 years down the line! —from the Foreword ofBishan Singh Bedi",

It provides detailed examples of how data mining can be helpful for decision-making in sports with special reference to cricket, particularly the quantitative features related to Twenty20 cricket, the latest and the most popular format of the game. The book highlights the performance quantification of cricketers (batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders, and wicket keepers), determining the market valuation of cricketers based on their on-field performances and the effect of age on the performance of the cricketers. It also provides a comprehensive overview of the different aspects of the game where quantitative techniques are beneficial, and highlights the use of statistical and data mining tools in analysing sports-related data and objective decision-making in sports. The book appeals to a wide readership, including postgraduate students of statistics/mathematics, data analysts, sports management bodies. It also offers data miners, such as researchers in statistics, mathematics, operations research, and computer science ideas for projects.",

Yet, when it comes to writing on the history of the game, Indians have been reticent and much of the past has been obscured and lost. Majumdar here recovers this history and restores it to its rightful place in India's rich sporting heritage.",

      "description": "Beginning COBOL for Programmers is a comprehensive, sophisticated tutorial and modular skills reference on the COBOL programming language for established programmers. This book is for you if you are a developer who would like to—or must—add COBOL to your repertoire. Perhaps you recognize the opportunities presented by the current COBOL skills crisis, or are working in a mission critical enterprise which retains legacy COBOL applications. Whatever your situation, Beginning COBOL for Programmers meets your needs as an established programmer moving to COBOL. Beginning COBOL for Programmers includes comprehensive coverage of ANS 85 COBOL features and techniques, including control structures, condition names, sequential and direct access files, data redefinition, string handling, decimal arithmetic, subprograms, and the report writer. The final chapter includes a substantial introduction to object-oriented COBOL. Benefiting from over one hundred example programs, you’ll receive an extensive introduction to the core and advanced features of the COBOL language and will learn to apply these through comprehensive and varied exercises. If you've inherited some legacy COBOL, you’ll be able to grasp the COBOL idioms, understand the constructs, and recognize what's happening in the code you’re working with. Today’s enterprise application developers will find that COBOL skills open new—or old—doors, and this extensive COBOL reference is the book to help you acquire and develop your COBOL skills.",

      "description": "This is the latest edition of our classic COBOL book that has set the standard for structured design and coding since the mid-1970s. So if you want to learn how to write COBOL programs the way they're written in the best enterprise COBOL shops, this is the book for you. And when you're done learning from this book, it becomes the best reference you'll ever find for use on the job. Throughout the book, you will learn how to use COBOL on IBM mainframes because that's where 90% or more of all COBOL is running. But to work on a mainframe, you need to know more than just the COBOL language. That's why this book also shows you: how to use the ISPF editor for entering programs; how to use TSO/E and JCL to compile and test programs; how to use the AMS utility to work with VSAM files; how to use CICS for developing interactive COBOL programs; how to use DB2 for developing COBOL programs that handle database data; how to maintain legacy programs. If you want to learn COBOL for other platforms, this book will get you off to a good start because COBOL is a standard language. In fact, all of the COBOL that's presented in this book will also run on any other platform that has a COBOL compiler. Remember, though, that billions of lines of mainframe COBOL are currently in use, and those programs will keep programmers busy for many years to come.",

Covering first the advantages of COBOL over other programming languages, the book discusses COBOL's divisions - identification, environment, procedure, and data, and then describes the testing of the COBOL source programs and program questions. The book is valuable for those who wish to learn basic COBOL language, but do not have the time to take manufacturers' or technical college courses. Intended readers include experienced computer programmers familiar with other programming languages but not with COBOL, as well as students taking a course in computer science. The book is also helpful as it includes self-assessment questions for readers to ensure they understood the principles covered.",

      "description": "COBOL for Students has established itself as one of the most successful teaching texts on COBOL programming and is now in its fourth edition. The first part of the book concentrates on the fundamentals of the language and takes students to the point where they can write modestly sized programs using sequential files. Part two assumes competence in elementary COBOL and explains design and other programming techniques which should be part of the professional programmer's repertoire. Part three extends the student's knowledge of the language by explaining some of the more advanced features of COBOL. Written for students learning COBOL for the first time, it takes the reader from the basic fundamentals right through to some of the more advanced features in one handy, and inexpensive volume. As many lecture courses have been based upon earlier editions of this book, this edition maintains the highly successful style and format and has been updated to include the 'Intrinsic Function Module for COBOL'. (This is the ANSI Standard X3.23a-1989 (COBOL 89) which has also been adopted as ISO International Standard 1989 Addendum 1 (an addendum to the ANSI Standard X3.23-1985 (COBOL 85)) and consists mainly of 42 predefined functions related to many different application areas).",

      "description": "As the conversion of legacy systems continues, the ability to understand embedded business rules becomes more and more critical. This ability is directly related to the structure of the programs within those systems. We also see the need to teach structured programming to a new generation of programmers who must maintain the billions of lines of existing COBOL code. The ultimate purpose of this text is to discuss how to judge the level of structure of a program. We do this by defining structured programming and then discussing how a structured program can be built through the application of the concepts of coupling and cohesion. We also show how embedded business rules of the program can be separated from the data and presentation functions. The reader will be able to use to these skills to judge and to improve the structure of a new program or an existing program.",

      "description": "A detailed introduction to the C programming language for experienced programmers. The world runs on code written in the C programming language, yet most schools begin the curriculum with Python or Java. Effective C bridges this gap and brings C into the modern era--covering the modern C17 Standard as well as potential C2x features. With the aid of this instant classic, you'll soon be writing professional, portable, and secure C programs to power robust systems and solve real-world problems. Robert C. Seacord introduces C and the C Standard Library while addressing best practices, common errors, and open debates in the C community. Developed together with other C Standards committee experts, Effective C will teach you how to debug, test, and analyze C programs. You'll benefit from Seacord's concise explanations of C language constructs and behaviors, and from his 40 years of coding experience. You'll learn: How to identify and handle undefined behavior in a C program The range and representations of integers and floating-point values How dynamic memory allocation works and how to use nonstandard functions How to use character encodings and types How to perform I/O with terminals and filesystems using C Standard streams and POSIX file descriptors How to understand the C compiler's translation phases and the role of the preprocessor How to test, debug, and analyze C programs Effective C will teach you how to write professional, secure, and portable C code that will stand the test of time and help strengthen the foundation of the computing world.",

One of the best-selling programming books published in the last fifty years, \"K&R\" has been called everything from the \"bible\" to \"a landmark in computer science\" and it has influenced generations of programmers. Available now for all leading ebook platforms, this concise and beautifully written text is a \"must-have\" reference for every serious programmer’s digital library. As modestly described by the authors in the Preface to the First Edition, this \"is not an introductory programming manual; it assumes some familiarity with basic programming concepts like variables, assignment statements, loops, and functions. Nonetheless, a novice programmer should be able to read along and pick up the language, although access to a more knowledgeable colleague will help.\"",
